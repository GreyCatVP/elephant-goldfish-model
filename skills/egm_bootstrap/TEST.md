# Verification and Evaluation Commands for `egm-bootstrap`

Frontmatter and link checks run in `pytest tests/unit`; behavioral evaluations run with `python tools/eval_runner.py --skill egm_bootstrap --model <model>` (see [TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md)).

## Manual Verification Scenarios

1. **Small Tree Execution (Sequential)**:
   - Target a directory with 2-5 subdirectories.
   - Verify that the agent executes sequentially without spawning subagents.
   - Verify generated `README.md` files contain Interface, Invariants, Side Effects, and relative links.
2. **Safety Gate Threshold (>15 Subdirectories)**:
   - Target a directory with 16+ subdirectories.
   - Verify that discovery pauses upon reaching >15 directories and requests user confirmation in chat before proceeding.
3. **Subagent Halting Gate**:
   - Run in an environment without task delegation tools.
   - Verify that the prominent halting banner is displayed and execution stops immediately.
