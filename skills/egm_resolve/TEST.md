# Test Plan: Goldfish Review Resolve Skill

Frontmatter and link checks run in `pytest tests/unit`; behavioral evaluations run with `python tools/eval_runner.py --skill egm_resolve --model <model>` (see [TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md)).

## Protocol Verification Checklist

When evaluating or exploring `egm_resolve` interactively in chat, verify:

-   **Step 1 (Intake & Context):** Ingests `TargetFile`, `LineRange`, and `FindingsList`.
-   **Step 2 (Evaluate & Categorize):** Defends valid design choices (`CONTEST`) and drafts concrete repairs (`PROPOSE FIX`).
-   **Step 3 (Report Fixes):** Generates `goldfish_review_report.md` artifact.
-   **Step 4 (Resolution Gate):** Prompts the user with clear decision choices (Auto accept, Continue, Interactive breakdown) without modal popups, and executes approved file modifications.
